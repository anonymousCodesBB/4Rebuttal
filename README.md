### For Reviewer coi2:

The results of supplementary ablation studies on hyperparameters $\lambda_{\rm u}$ and $\lambda_{\rm re}$ on the datasets of SVHN(v=400, r=3) and STL-10(r=7) are provided in lambda_SVHN.pdf and lambda_STL10.pdf.

### For Reviewer QKF1:

The running time of comparing methods on the datasets of SVHN(v=400, r=3), cifar10(v=400,r=5), cifar100(v=100,r=15) and stl-10(r=7) are provided in time_complexity.pdf.

The supplementary classification results of CODUAL and comparing algorithms instantiated with ResNet-18 are provided in Backbone_Table.pdf.
